            Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively manage personal finances. It includes skills such as 
            budgeting, saving, investing, and handling debt. Being financially literate helps individuals make informed decisions, 
            avoid financial pitfalls, and plan for the future. It empowers people to achieve financial security, build wealth, 
            and improve their overall quality of life.
